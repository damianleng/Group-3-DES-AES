# Cryptography Project

Welcome to our cryptography project! This repository showcases both symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods for secure data handling.

## Features

- **Symmetric Encryption**: Utilizes AES 128-bit encryption for users to encrypt and decrypt their data securely.
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Employs Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE) for users to exchange keys securely, followed by Data Encryption Standard (DES) for data encryption.
- **User Interface**: Incorporates the Streamlit library for a user-friendly interface, allowing users to easily interact with encryption and decryption functionalities.

## How to Run

Follow these simple steps to run the code:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Streamlit installed. You can install it using pip:
    ```
    pip install streamlit
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Folder**: Open your terminal and navigate to the location of the project folder.

3. **Run the Application**: Use the following commands to run the respective applications:
    - For AES application (Symmetric Encryption):
        ```
        streamlit run symmetric.py
        ```
    - For DHKE application (Asymmetric Encryption):
        ```
        streamlit run asymmetric.py
        ```
